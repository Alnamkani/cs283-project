# CS283 Project

## Getting Started

### Cloning the Repository

You can clone this repository using either HTTPS or SSH. Make sure to use the `--recursive` flag to get all submodules:

#### Using HTTPS
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Alnamkani/cs283-project.git
```

Note: If you forgot to use `--recursive` during cloning, you can initialize and update submodules later with:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
